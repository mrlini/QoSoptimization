# QoSoptimization
EMOAS for the QoS optimization problem

Based on ECJ framework, version 20 (https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/).

For running the algorithms on the QoS optimization problem see class MainServiciiReale from the package "src.org.utcluj.moo.optimizareServiciiReale". Here one can setup the general parameters of the evolutionary process, chose the number of objectives to be optimized, choose one of the implementd algorithms (NSGA-II, SPEA2, MOEA/D, GDE3, POSDE), and chose the number of concrete and abstract services of the work-flow. The result (Pareto front or quality indicator) are written in a separate file for each algorithm and work-flow instance.
